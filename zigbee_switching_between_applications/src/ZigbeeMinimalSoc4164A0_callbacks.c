/** @brief Complete
 *
 * This callback is fired when the Network Steering plugin is complete.
 *
 * @param status On success this will be set to EMBER_SUCCESS to indicate a
 * network was joined successfully. On failure this will be the status code of
 * the last join or scan attempt. Ver.: always
 * @param totalBeacons The total number of 802.15.4 beacons that were heard,
 * including beacons from different devices with the same PAN ID. Ver.: always
 * @param joinAttempts The number of join attempts that were made to get onto
 * an open Zigbee network. Ver.: always
 * @param finalState The finishing state of the network steering process. From
 * this, one is able to tell on which channel mask and with which key the
 * process was complete. Ver.: always
