# Who is this boot camp for?

The following bootcamp is focused on providing a hands on experience on the development of IoT technologies with the Silicon Labs EmberZnet Stack and Simplicity IDE. We will give a brief introduction of Zigbee and users can expect to work through a series of workshops to develop their own Zigbee network. Users will also have the ability to reference other Silicon Labs documentation for more detailed learning.

By the end of the hands-on tutorials the user will know how to use the Simplicity IDE to build, customize, and implement applications that utilize Zigbee. 

# Zigbee Boot Camp
We have prepared a series of hands-on modules to implement the Zigbee protocol and familiarize the user with SimplicityStudio V5. The user should complete the following modules:

1. [Forming and Joining:](Zigbee-Hands-on-Forming-and-Joining) Form a basic centralized Zigbee network using a zigbee minimal sample application
2. [Sending on/off commands:](Zigbee-Hands-on-Sending-OnOff-Commands) Use Zigbee device to control LED status and send zcl commands using the ON/OFF Cluster
3. [Using Event:](Zigbee-Hands-on-Using-Event) Execute custom code to control LED blink
4. [Non-volatile Data Storage:](Zigbee-Hands-on-Non-volatile-Data-Storage): Implement custom tokens 

Each module builds on the former module so we strongly recommend completing these in order. Before starting the modules, make sure you have Simplicity Studio v5 installed and configured.

NOTE: QSG-180 is designed for developers who are new to Zigbee EmberZNet and the Silicon Labs development hardware. It provides basic information on configuring, building, and installing applications for the EFR32MG family of
SoCs. Completing QSG-180 prior to the Zigbee Bootcamp is recommended.
