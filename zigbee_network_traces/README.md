## Summary ##
This repository provides projects and network traces about basic network Policies on Zigbee.

## List of Projects ##
**Joining Policies** :
* Joining_InstallCode : To join a network with install-code
* Joining_WellKnownKey : Join with the well-known key "ZigbeeAlliance09"

**Rejoining Policies** :
* Secured_Rejoining : Secured Rejoining of a SED aged out of the child table of the parent
* **UN**Secured_Rejoining : Unsecured rejoining of a SED which missed a NWK Key update

**TC Policies** :
* TC_GlobalLinkKey : Use a global TC link key for all nodes
* TC_HashedLinkKey : Use a global TC Link key which is hashed by the eui64 of each node
* TC_UniqueLinkKey : Use a random unique TC link key for each node joining the network

**NWK Key Update** :
* Network_KeyUpdate : Demonstrate the network update with broadcast

**App Link Keys**
* appLinkKey : Use a unique APP Link key to secure communication between 2 nodes on a network

**Messaging** :
* Multicast_SwitchLight : Project to send multicast message to a specific Group

## Structure of Projects ##
You can see in all the projects the following structures :
* Src : Source code files used for the project
* SimplicityStudio : Export files for all the projects
* Traces directly into the directory
* README : Explains how to use the project

## Gecko SDK version ##

v4.1

## Hardware Required ##

* 3x Wireless Starter Kit Main Board
* 3x BRD4180A

## Connections Required ##

Connect the radio boards to the WSTK mainboards.

## Setup ##

Look at each guidelines present in each projects in this repository.


## How It Works ##

Some Wireshark/Network Analyzer traces are directly available in order to explore the different packet exchanges

## .sls Projects Used ##

Present on every Simplicity Studio folders for each sub-project.

## Create your own CLI Commands ##
Here are the steps on how to use/create custom CLI commands, follow the examples in the various projects of this
repository for more information.
* Create the handler responsible to handle the command and gets the sl_cli_command_arg_t* arguments.
* Create the CLI command info of type sl_cli_command_info_t with the SL_CLI_COMMAND
* Create the entries which are going to define the command name to put in the CLI and the callback to the correct handler
* Create the group of commands which is going to have the entries of commands in its arguments
* In the emberAfMainInitCallback function, sl_cli_command_add_command_group to the sl_cli_handles

## Usefull links and Applications Notes ##

Here's one useful Application Note on the Zigbee Framework which gives guidance on custom commands and events :
